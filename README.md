# Colour Theory
Hello! Not sure how you stumbled on this repository, but this is a site I made for my grade 10 ICT class. 
It's pretty basic and looking back it has some questionable design decisions, such as a navbar with text that disappears if you're not hovering over them.

...
Kinda defeats the purpose of a quick-access navbar huh?

I've fixed that little design quirk but there's a few more less glaring issues I've left as-is, and will probably keep the site that way. 
A reminder of my past, I suppose.

Enjoy the site, maybe learn some colour theory, and I'll hopefully seeya around!
